Hey guys!
Welcome back to another set of killer elixir tips.

This article comprises of another **10** **elixir** tips which may useful in our daily programming.

I am using the following development stack at the moment of writing this article.

```elixir
Hex:    0.18.1
Elixir: 1.7.3
OTP:    21.1.1
```

## 1‚Äî Replacing a Key in Map

I know, you might be thinking why some one would do that. I too had the same feeling until I met with a requirement in one of my previous projects where I was asked to replace `address1` with `address` and some other keys as well. It is a huge one. I have to do change many keys as well.

I‚Äôm here with a simple `map` to keep it understandable. But, the technique is same.
> The thing to remember is; be smart and stay long;

```elixir
details = %{name: "john", address1: "heaven", mobile1: "999999999"}
```

The above map comprises of **two** weird keys address1 and mobile1 where we do workout on to take over them.

```elixir
iex> details = %{name: "john", address1: "heaven", mobile1: "999999999"}
%{address1: "heaven", mobile1: "999999999", name: "john"}

iex> Map.new(details, fn  
  {:address1, address} -> {:address, address}
  {:mobile1, mobile} -> {:phone, mobile} 
  x -> x 
end)

%{address: "heaven", name: "john", phone: "999999999"} #output
```

### What‚Äôs the magic here‚ùì

Nothing , just pattern_matching , the boon for functional programmers. The magic lies inside Map.new and the **anonymous** function where we used our **magic band **to see the actual **logic**.

## 2‚Äî Exchanging the Two values

This is just to know things can be done in **elixir** for beginners.

```elixir
iex> x=5
5
iex> y=7
7
iex> {x,y}={y,x}
{7,5}

iex>x
7
iex>y
5
```

## 3 ‚Äî Filtering With match?

As we know, `Enum.filter` will do the job based on the evaluation of a condition. But still, we can use the **pattern** to **filter** things.

Let me make you clear with the following example.

I have a list of **users** where their names are mapped to their preferred programming language.

```elixir
iex> user_and_programming_languages = 
 %{john: "elixir", latha: "elixir", hari: "erlang", toy: "perl"}

%{hari: "erlang", john: "elixir", latha: "elixir", toy: "perl"}
```

Like above, the **user_names** are mapped with their **languages**. Now, our job is to filter the ***users*** of **elixir** language.

Just let me know which one you do prefer after checking out the following‚Ä¶

```elixir
iex> user_and_programming_languages |>
Enum.filter(fn {_, lang} -> lang=="elixir" end )

[john: "elixir", latha: "elixir"]  
#output
```

OR, using match? for pattern based

```elixir
user_and_programming_languages = 
 %{john: "elixir", latha: "elixir", hari: "erlang", toy: "perl"}
 
user_and_programming_languages |>
Enum.filter(&match?({_, "elixir"}, &1) )

[john: "elixir", latha: "elixir"]  
#output
```

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3844/1*yLgMcHqdSgWhNQFhXqjXgw.png)

I took the simpler lines of code to give a demo of using match? but, it‚Äôs usages are limit less. Just think about the **pattern** and match over it. Think out of the box guys. But don‚Äôt blow up your mind and don‚Äôt blame me for that.

**Warning: ‚ö†Ô∏è**

Make sure of your **pattern** as the **first** parameter to the match? otherwise, you have to pay for the compiler. Just kidding üòÉ

```elixir
iex> user_and_programming_languages |>
Enum.filter(&match?(&1, {_, "elixir"},) )
```

Let‚Äôs bump for more.

## 4 ‚Äî Bangpipe <|> Left and Right

As we know elixir is free language, where you can build anything you need. But, be careful It is just to show you something is achievable.

It is a **LEFT** and **RIGHT** Pipe

We usually end up with some sort of results in the format {:ok, result} . This can be found anywhere in your project sooner or later.

If you pipe it to the function obviously you will end up with an unknown expectation. I am talking about run-time errors. Our |> is not smart enough to check it for whether is a direct result or {:ok, result} .

Let‚Äôs build it for the **GOD** sake but not for your **client**.

‚ö†Ô∏è ***Don‚Äôt use this ever and don‚Äôt do write macros until you write new framework.***

```elixir
iex> defmodule Bangpipe do
  defmacro left <|> right do
    quote do
      unquote(left)
      |> case do
        {:ok, val} -> val 
        val -> val
      end
      |> unquote(right)
    end
  end
end
```

This Bangpipe I mean <|> is defined to do the task. Before sending the result to the function in right, it is performing the pattern matching over the result to identify what kinda result it is. I hope you understood what actually the result I am talking about.

*Just for Fun](https://medium.com/blackode/the-secret-behind-elixir-operator-overriding-to-a564fd6c0dd6)*

We can also do re definitions on elixir operators. Check above URL.

How to use ‚ùì

Just import **Bangpipe** the left-right pipe will be loaded. Copy and paste to experience it in live and fast into iex

```elixir
iex[6]  import Bangpipe
Bangpipe

iex[7]  data = {:ok, [1,2,3,4,5]} 
{:ok, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]}

iex[8]  data <|> length
5
```

## 5 ‚Äî mix hex.info

This is highly recommended command to check out **what hex version** is installed and how it is **build** with.

### Why is that useful?

I have had experienced a bug in the project in my machine but not from my co-programmer though we work on the same project. The actual problem is we are using different hex versions. I come to know this by running mix hex.info in both systems. That saved a lot of time.

```elixir
mix hex.info
```

That gives the information about the hex and how it is built with.

![mix hex.info](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3830/1*3AaPhLgTwlYDPX-tfkbslg.png)*mix hex.info*

Similarly, we can find the information of any package like mix hex.info package_name

```elixir
mix hex.info typex
```

![mix hex.info typex](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3822/1*KdnXWiWt8IiORNUgJIrUxQ.png)*mix hex.info typex*

You can be more specific too by mentioning the version of the package.

```elixir
mix hex.info <<package_name>> <<version>>
```

Replace ***<<package_name>>*** and ***<<version>>*** as you required.

## 6 ‚Äî Finding the function callers in a project.

*Let‚Äôs create a brief story here.*

The moment when GOD‚ÄôS are against you, your manager will come and give you a vast legacy project code and asked you to find out ***all the places where a particular function*** is called. In a sentence, the **callers** of a particular function.

**What will you do?** I don‚Äôt think it is a smart way of surfing in each and every file. I don‚Äôt. So, you don‚Äôt.

```elixir
mix xref callers Module.function

example

mix xref callers Poison.decode
```

Prints all callers of the given **CALLEE**, which can be one of: **Module**,
**Module.function**, or **Module.function/arity**.

### Examples:

```elixir
mix xref callers ***Module***
mix xref callers ***Module.fun***
mix xref callers ***Module.fun/3***
```

![mix xref callers Poison.decode](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3818/1*5pDTNeE2I0lrqBlR18inOQ.png)*mix xref callers Poison.decode*

You can add function arity to be more specific, in this case mix xref callers Poison.decode/1 .

**BOOM !** Now, you can surprise the manager with results before he reaches his cabin. Be fast and smart.

I solely experienced this when my co-worker I better say **co-programmer** asked for help regarding the situation but no manager in my case.

```elixir
mix help **xref**
```

## 7 ‚Äî Integer to Float Conversion

You need this in rare cases to meet the type specifications while evaluating some kinda conditional code logic which results to a Boolean value.

```elixir
iex[12] 5.0==5             # types are not considered here
true
iex[13] 5.0===5          # types are strict considered here
false
```

To convert integer to float I just divide the value by 1 using Kernel./ .

```elixir
iex[2] val = 5
5
iex[3] is_integer val
true
iex[4] val = val/1
5.0
iex[5] is_integer val
false
iex[6] is_float val
true
```

## **8 ‚Äî Sigils & Interpolation**

As you already know sigils will help us in less typing for creative stuff. 
Consider the following example of defining a list of strings.

```elixir
sentence = ["I", "Love", "coding", "in", "elixir"]
```

That is a lot of typing here. We can improve this without typing any " marks with the help of ~w **sigil**.

It returns a list of ‚Äúwords‚Äù split by whitespace. Character unescaping and
**interpolation** happens for each word.

```elixir
sentence = ~w(I Love coding in elixir)
```

We can still use the interpolation as well. Suppose, I would like to make the language dynamic in the above sentence, I mean one loves elixir and other loves some other languages . So, let‚Äôs put the language in a variable lang and interpolate it over.

```elixir
iex[6] lang = "haskel"
"haskel"
iex[7] sentence = **~w(I Love #{lang})**
["I", "Love", "haskel"]
iex[8] lang = "Rust"
"Rust"
iex[9] sentence = ~w(I Love #{lang})
["I", "Love", "Rust"]
```

What if you don‚Äôt want the interpolation? just use ~W a capital form.

```elixir
iex[10] sentence = ~W(I Love #{lang})
["I", "Love", "\#{lang}"]
```

## 9 ‚Äî Grouping of things

I have a collection of hotel_bookings and I need to group them based on their booking status.

To keep this simple, I am just using some false random collection.

```elixir
iex> hotel_bookings = [ 
%{name: "John", country: "usa", booking_status: :success},
%{name: "Hari", country: "india", booking_status: :fail},
%{name: "Mahesh", country: "austria", booking_status: :pending},
%{name: "Ruchi", country: "paris", booking_status: :success},
%{name: "Nitesh", country: "malasia", booking_status: :success},
%{name: "Manoj", country: "japan", booking_status: :fail},
%{name: "Akhilesh", country: "china", booking_status: :pending},
%{name: "Rajesh", country: "india", booking_status: :fail},
%{name: "Payal", country: "london", booking_status: :success},
%{name: "Kumar", country: "france", booking_status: :fail}
]
```

Let‚Äôs group the things.

```elixir
iex> Enum.group_by(hotel_bookings, &Map.get(&1, :booking_status))
%{
  fail: [
    %{booking_status: :fail, country: "india", name: "Hari"},
    %{booking_status: :fail, country: "japan", name: "Manoj"},
    %{booking_status: :fail, country: "india", name: "Rajesh"},
    %{booking_status: :fail, country: "france", name: "Kumar"}
  ],
  pending: [
    %{booking_status: :pending, country: "austria", name: "Mahesh"},
    %{booking_status: :pending, country: "china", name: "Akhilesh"}
  ],
  success: [
    %{booking_status: :success, country: "usa", name: "John"},
    %{booking_status: :success, country: "paris", name: "Ruchi"},
    %{booking_status: :success, country: "malasia", name: "Nitesh"}, 
    %{booking_status: :success, country: "london", name: "Payal"}
  ]
}
```

This is well and good but I need only name in the list instead of map. I mean some thing like %{fail: ["Hari", "Manoj"], ...}

We just need to tell the group_by what to return in return of grouping

```elixir
iex>  Enum.group_by(hotel_bookings, &Map.get(&1, :booking_status), &Map.get(&1, :name))
%{
  fail: ["Hari", "Manoj", "Rajesh", "Kumar"],
  pending: ["Mahesh", "Akhilesh"],
  success: ["John", "Ruchi", "Nitesh", "Payal"]
}
```

## 10 ‚Äî Running your previous failed test only

```elixir
mix test --failed
```

## BONUS

### Documentation Metadata

In a project, there will be many programmers who write different modules. It will hard to find who has written what.

To keep the track of such things, we can add metadata to the @moduledoc . So, we come to know the developer whom we can blame to queries that hit to your mind and kept eating it while using the module.

```elixir
@moduledoc "Wrong code leads you to the right bug "
@moduledoc authors: ["blackode", "doe"], since: "1.1.2"
```
